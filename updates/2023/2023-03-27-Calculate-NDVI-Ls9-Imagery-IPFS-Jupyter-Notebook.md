## NDVI on Landsat 9 imagery with data using IPFS

Geospatial professionals often work with large amounts of data, such as satellite imagery, for object detection, land cover classification, and more. One common technique used in such analyses is the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), which is a simple and effective way to quantify the presence and health of vegetation in an area. In this blog post, we will explore how to calculate NDVI on Landsat 9 imagery using IPFS in a Jupyter notebook. We will also highlight the advantages of using IPFS for geospatial workflows, including content-addressing and decentralization.
