## NDVI on Landsat 9 imagery with data using IPFS

Geospatial professionals frequently handle vast data sets, like satellite imagery, for tasks ranging from object detection to land cover classification. The Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) is a widely-used metric for assessing vegetation health in a given area. In this blog post, we'll walk you through calculating NDVI using Landsat 9 imagery and the IPFS network with the help of the Python library, ipfs-stac, in a Jupyter notebook. We'll also discuss the benefits of leveraging IPFS in geospatial workflows, such as content-addressing and decentralization.
