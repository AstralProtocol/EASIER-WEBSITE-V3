## Introduction

As decentralized web technology continues to develop, the InterPlanetary File System (IPFS) offers an alternative approach to distributed file storage and sharing. In this notebook, we will present a proof of concept for building a flexible local client capable of fetching files from IPFS, regardless of whether the user has a local IPFS node or not. We will also discuss the advantages of using a local IPFS node over relying on public gateways, and showcase how to implement a fallback mechanism for maintaining uninterrupted access to IPFS content.
