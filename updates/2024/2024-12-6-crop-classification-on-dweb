## Crop Classification on the Dweb

Ever wondered how satellites help us understand what's growing on our planet? In a world facing population growth, erratic weather, and food security challenges, crop classification has become a crucial tool for modern agriculture. By using satellite data to identify and track different types of crops, we can deliver critical analyses of global agriculture information. In this post, we'll dive into how NASA's Harmonized Landsat and Sentinel-2 (HLS) data and the USDA's Cropland Data Layer (CDL) are used in a multi-temporal crop classification pipeline. We'll explore the use of decentralized networks such as IPFS and Filecoin and how it offers a more resilient and accessible approach for agricultural analysis and decision-making processes.  Whether you're new to crop classification or just curious about how these systems work together to forecast yields and inform agricultural decisions, this post will give you a perspective into the process and its potential impact on global food security.
