## A More Streamlined and Accessible Codebase for the Community

We are bringing together the work from Astral and EASIER into a unified ecosystem as [The Decentralized Geospatial Collaborative](https://decentralizedgeo.org/). This initiative aims to enhance decentralized geospatial tools, foster community collaboration, and develop a proof-of-location framework with broader applications. By merging these repositories, we are not only consolidating development efforts but also making it easier for contributors to engage with the project.

## What Changed?

Previously, the [Astral](https://github.com/AstralProtocol) and [EASIER](https://github.com/easierdata/) projects were spread across multiple repositories with varying levels of documentation and consistency. We have now consolidated these repositories under the [DecentralizedGeo GitHub organization](https://github.com/DecentralizedGeo), providing a unified space for decentralized geospatial tools and frameworks.

### Key Updates

- **Repository Transfers:** Several core projects have been moved to the DecentralizedGeo GitHub organization, ensuring a more structured development environment:

  - `astral-api` - Unified API for location proof attestations
  - `Decentralized Location Logger` - Decentralized geotagged log entries
  - `ipfs-stac` - Python client for interfacing with Easier STAC Server
  - `web3-geo-dashboard` - UI for geospatial Web3 applications
  - And more!

- **Centralized Documentation Hub:** We have created a new [DecentralizedGeo Hub](https://decentralizedgeo.github.io/DecentralizedGeo-hub/) that consolidates all documentation in one place, making it easier to explore project details, APIs, and developer resources.

- **Contribution Guidelines:** A clear set of [contribution guidelines](https://decentralizedgeo.github.io/DecentralizedGeo-hub/contribute/contributing-guidelines/) has been introduced to help new contributors get started quickly.

- **Improved Development Practices:** With this migration, we have standardized repository structures, refined APIs, and aligned our work with broader decentralized geospatial initiatives. This effort lays the foundation for further development, including a **general proof-of-location claim specification** that supports various validation mechanisms using blockchain and decentralized storage.

## Why This Matters

This migration isn’t just about moving code—it’s about making our projects more accessible, maintainable, and scalable. Some key benefits include:

- **Easier Onboarding:** New contributors can now navigate our repositories and documentation more efficiently.
- **Improved Collaboration:** A more structured organization enables smoother collaboration across teams and projects.
- **Future Growth:** A cleaner architecture lays the groundwork for expanding our ecosystem of decentralized geospatial tools.
- **Alignment with Future Goals:** This restructuring is a crucial step toward developing a **proof-of-location framework**, integrating IPFS/Filecoin for decentralized data storage, and enhancing the capabilities of Web3 geospatial applications.

## Get Involved

We’d love for the community to explore the new setup and contribute. Here’s how:

- **Check Out the Documentation** – Visit the [DecentralizedGeo Hub](https://decentralizedgeo.github.io/DecentralizedGeo-hub/) to explore the projects.
- **Contribute** – Follow our [contribution guidelines](https://decentralizedgeo.github.io/DecentralizedGeo-hub/contribute/contributing-guidelines/) to see how you can help.
- **Join the Conversation** – Share your feedback, ask questions, or contribute ideas on our social media and dev channels.

This is just the beginning of a more streamlined and community-driven future for decentralized geospatial technologies. Stay tuned for more updates!
