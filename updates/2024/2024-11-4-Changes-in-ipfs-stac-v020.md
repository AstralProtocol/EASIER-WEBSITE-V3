## Preface

One of the pivotal projects the EASIER Data Initiative has produced is [ipfs-stac](https://pypi.org/project/ipfs-stac/). The Python library is a testament to the feasibility of onboarding and interfacing geospatial data on IPFS. The library enables developers and researchers to leverage STAC APIs enriched with Filecoin and IPFS metadata to seamlessly fetch, pin, and explore data in a familiar manner. In an ambiguous ecosystem with everchanging advancements, updates, breaking changes, and new features of the infrastructure will emerge. The team has made it a responsibility to adhere to these changes and that has prompted our projects to remain flexible. This notebook will explore the many new features and changes to ipfs-stac in version 0.2. To stay up to date with the development and release of new features, consider starring our [respository for ipfs-stac](https://github.com/easierdata/ipfs-stac)
