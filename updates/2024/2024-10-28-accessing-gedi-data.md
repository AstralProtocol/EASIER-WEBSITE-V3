## Accessing GEDI Data with IPFS

Measuring the impact of deforestation is one of the many overarching goals of the [Global Ecosystem Dynamics Investigation](https://gedi.umd.edu/mission/mission-overview/) (GEDI) project. With support of the GEDI's [LIDAR system](https://gedi.umd.edu/mission/technology/) and hitching a ride on the International Space Station, high-quality laser ranging observations collect a 3D structure of the Earths forests for which can be used to estimate the height of forests, the density of vegetation, and providing detail on the Earths carbon cycle. In this blog post, we will  explore the GEDI dataset by leveraging IPFS with the ipfs-stac python library.
